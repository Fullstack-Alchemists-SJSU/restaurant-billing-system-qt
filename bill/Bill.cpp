    // This function should interact with the Order class to generate the bill details.
    // Since we don't have Order class, we'll leave it as a placeholder.

    // Example placeholder code:
    // totalAmount = order.calculateTotal(); // Where 'calculateTotal' would be a method of the Order class
}

    // Print bill details to the console
    std::cout << "Bill ID: " << billID << "\n";

}

// The generateBill method would normally fetch the total from the Order object.
// The printBill method prints out the bill's details. Once you have the Order class,
// you can include it to make these methods work as intended.
